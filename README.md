**Fancy BLE Scanner â€“ README**

This project is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Scanner GUI built with Python, PyQt5, and Bleak.
It scans nearby BLE devices in real-time, displays their name, MAC address, and RSSI signal strength in a color-coded bar.

**Features**

Real-time BLE scanning using Bleak
 (cross-platform Bluetooth library).

**Fancy GUI built with PyQt5**
.

Color-coded RSSI bars:

ğŸŸ¢ Green â†’ Strong signal (> -60 dBm)

ğŸŸ  Orange â†’ Medium signal (-80 to -60 dBm)

ğŸ”´ Red â†’ Weak signal (< -80 dBm)

Automatic refresh every second.

Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Clone the repo (or copy ble_scan_GUI.py).

**Install required dependencies:**
pip install bleak pyqt5

import sys, asyncio, threading
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QTableWidget, QTableWidgetItem, QVBoxLayout, QWidget, QProgressBar
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QTimer
from bleak import BleakScanner
PyQt5 â†’ GUI framework

Bleak â†’ Bluetooth scanning library

Threading + asyncio â†’ Run BLE scanning in background while GUI stays responsive


**Notes**

On Windows, you must run inside a Python venv (Bleak requirement).
On Linux/macOS, run with sudo if devices donâ€™t appear.
RSSI fluctuates, so colors will update dynamically.
